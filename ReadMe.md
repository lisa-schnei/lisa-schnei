--------------------------------------------

Market researcher with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, and data visualization tools (e.g. Tableau). Currently retraining as a Data Analyst to leverage my expertise in quantitative analysis and customer research in the data analytics field.

With 4.5 years of experience in market research, I have built strong skills in asking the right questions, gathering, analysing and interpreting data that lead to meaningful business insights. My project management experience has also equipped me with exceptional coordination, organizational, and time-management skills, which I apply to data analytics and all aspects of my work.

I bring a unique combination of analytical thinking, customer focus, a service-oriented approach with a drive to constantly learn in life and at work.
